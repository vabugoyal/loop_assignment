uptime/downtime
        last-hour : tell minutes
                we are making polls every hour, so we can only make
                predictions about the last hour.



        last-day : tell hours
        last-week : tell hours
            we have business hours for a store let they be 9AM - 9PM
            So, we have 12 hours
            for each hour we will be having a poll


                we will store how many of them turned out to be active
                out of all the polls we had
                32(polls done) -> 21(active polls)
                54(polls needed) -> (32/21 * 54)(predicted active hours)

                what to do when we have no polls for the previous n days?
                -> we will use the previous data to make predictions






TODO:
1.





Issues:
1.   There were duplicate entries for a  (store, day) tuple. So I have taken
     the first one.
